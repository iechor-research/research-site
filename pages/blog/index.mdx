[Download Research CLI](/#installation) to get started, and read on to discover how it can transform your research process.

## üéì What is Research CLI?

Research CLI is more than just a terminal application - it's a complete academic research ecosystem that brings together:

- **Literature Search & Management**: Search across arXiv, PubMed, IEEE, and Google Scholar
- **AI-Powered Writing Assistant**: Generate outlines, improve writing style, and format citations
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning
- **LaTeX Management**: Create, compile, and manage LaTeX documents
- **Journal Submission**: Find suitable journals and prepare submission packages

All accessible through an intuitive command-line interface that integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Literature Search & Bibliography Management

Research CLI connects to multiple academic databases, allowing you to search and manage literature from a single interface:

```bash
# Search across multiple databases
research search "machine learning" --source=arxiv --limit=10

# Add papers to your bibliography
research bib add arxiv:1706.03762 --title="Attention Is All You Need"

# Format citations in any style
research bib format --style=IEEE --output=references.bib
```

**Supported databases:**
- arXiv (Physics, Math, CS)
- PubMed (Life Sciences)
- IEEE Xplore (Engineering)
- Google Scholar (All fields)

### AI-Powered Paper Writing

Generate structured outlines and get writing assistance for any type of academic paper:

```bash
# Generate a research paper outline
research outline EXPERIMENTAL COMPUTER_SCIENCE --journal="Nature"

# Get writing help for specific sections
research write introduction --style=academic --length=800

# Check grammar and style
research check draft.tex --type=all
```

**Paper types supported:**
- Experimental research papers
- Survey/review papers
- Theoretical papers
- Conference papers
- Thesis chapters

### Data Analysis & Visualization

Built-in tools for analyzing research data and generating publication-ready visualizations:

```bash
# Analyze your dataset
research data analyze results.csv --type=all --output=report.html

# Generate visualizations
research data visualize experiment.csv --type=scatter --x=feature1 --y=target

# Statistical analysis
research data analyze survey.csv --type=correlation
```

**Analysis capabilities:**
- Descriptive statistics
- Hypothesis testing
- Correlation analysis
- Machine learning
- Time series analysis

### LaTeX Project Management

Complete LaTeX workflow management with templates for major journals:

```bash
# Create a new paper project
research latex create ./my-paper --template=ieee_conference

# Compile with different engines
research latex compile ./my-paper --engine=PDFLATEX --bibtex

# Clean temporary files
research latex clean ./my-paper
```

**Available templates:**
- IEEE Conference/Journal
- ACM Article
- Springer Journal
- Nature/Science
- Thesis templates

### Journal Matching & Submission

Find the perfect journal for your research and prepare submission packages:

```bash
# Find suitable journals
research submit match "Deep Learning for NLP" "Abstract text..." --field=COMPUTER_SCIENCE

# Prepare submission package
research submit prepare ./my-paper --journal="Nature Machine Intelligence"
```

## üí° Real-World Use Cases

### Case Study 1: Graduate Student Literature Review

Sarah, a PhD student in Computer Science, needed to conduct a comprehensive literature review on transformer architectures:

```bash
# Step 1: Search for relevant papers
research search "transformer architecture" --source=arxiv --limit=50

# Step 2: Search related topics
research search "attention mechanism" --source=arxiv,scholar --limit=30

# Step 3: Organize references
research bib format --style=ACM --output=transformer_refs.bib

# Step 4: Generate outline
research outline SURVEY COMPUTER_SCIENCE --journal="ACM Computing Surveys"
```

**Result**: Sarah completed her literature review 60% faster and discovered 15 highly relevant papers she would have missed with traditional search methods.

### Case Study 2: Research Team Collaboration

Dr. Martinez's research team was preparing a paper on medical image analysis:

```bash
# Generate project structure
research latex create ./medical-imaging --template=nature

# Analyze experimental results
research data analyze patient_data.csv --type=statistical --output=analysis.html

# Check paper quality
research check manuscript.tex --type=all

# Find target journals
research submit match "Medical Image Analysis" "Abstract..." --field=MEDICINE
```

**Result**: The team reduced their submission preparation time by 40% and received acceptance on their first submission.

### Case Study 3: Data Science Research

Alex, a data scientist, was analyzing social media sentiment data:

```bash
# Generate analysis code
research experiment python ml --output=./sentiment_analysis

# Analyze the dataset
research data analyze social_media.csv --type=ml --algorithms=svm,random_forest

# Visualize results
research data visualize results.csv --type=heatmap --save=figures/

# Prepare IEEE paper
research latex create ./sentiment-paper --template=ieee_journal
```

**Result**: Alex generated a complete analysis pipeline and paper draft in 2 days instead of the usual 2 weeks.
